# Server of ECOLETA

[ECOLETA](https://ecoleta-frontend.netlify.app/) is an web application developed to help people discard waste such as lamps, stacks, batteries and many more. It does so by mapping collection spots so everyone can be in touch with the entity who does the job.

## Design

This application's design was made by the [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) team and made available during the NLW or Next Level Week, you can currently check the prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/file/1SxgOMojOB2zYT0Mdk28lB/?viewer=1&node-id=)

## Stack

The server was originally built using NodeJs with express and knex using Typescript instead of standard Javascript by the Rocketseat team, but as the event was the Next Level Week, I took an step further and developed the backend using express and [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for handling everything related to the Postgres database.

## Deploy

The React application for the frontend was deployed [here](https://ecoleta-frontend.netlify.app/) using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and the backend along the PostgreSQL Database were deployed using [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
